# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
This was actually pretty difficult. I felt like I wasn't super prepared to take on this project, I don't think I knew enough and I ended up struggling through most of it, to be honest. I think it was a bit too hard for a second assignment. I think maybe you could have given some more hints and tips throughout the walkthrough.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I did however learn a whole lot of stuff by trial and error (I think). There was a lot of stuff I learned on the fly and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
Haha, all of them and more.


## How could this assignment be improved?
Make it easier by giving a more detailed walkthrough to complete the assignment. I felt lost a lot of the time.
